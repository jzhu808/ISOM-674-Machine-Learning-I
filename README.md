# ISOM 674: Machine Learning I
> This course will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning. Both supervised and unsupervised learning will be covered, although most of the course will be focused on supervised learning. Supervised learning will be examined for both classification and prediction problems. The basic ideas of neural networks will be presented. Machine learning from data streams (online learning) using stochastic gradient descent will also be covered.


### Group Projects
- Project 1 - Use multiple machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosting tools like RandomForest and XGBoost, to increase the accuracy of a predictive model
  > Tools Used: RStudio
